// Micro Services

Small Autonomous systems which communicate with each other via REST (HTTP protocols) which are deployed in Cloud
For eg) If we have 5-10 microservices, each one can have many instances to handle request

// Challenges
1) Finding the Boundaries
2) Config. Management
3) Dynamic Scale Up and Scale Down (loads may differ, depending on it we need to create that many instances. All this with Dynamic Load Balancing)
4) Visiblity (If bug or any issue occurs we need to know where excatly it occured, which microservice and also we need to be able to monitor 100's of microservices)
5) Pack Of cards (if not well designed, it will be a pack of cards) There would be a certain microservice that would be fundamental for everything, coz all others may depend on it or built on top of it.Thats why its a pack of cards(built on one another). If it goes down and then everything might go. So we shud have Fault Tolerance
