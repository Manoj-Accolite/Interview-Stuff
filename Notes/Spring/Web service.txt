// Web Service
Software system designed to support interoperable (able to exchange and make use of information) machine-to-machine interaction over a network.

3 keys
1) Designed for machine-to-machine(appln-to-appln) interaction
2) Shud be interoperable (not platform dependent)
3) shud allow communication over a network

// How??
1) How does data exchange b/w applns take place??
	i/p to a web service is called request and o/p from a web service is called response.
2) How to make web service platform independent??
	request and response shud be platform independent. So formats can be xml or json (Message exchange format)
3) How does a appln know the format of request and response??

Service Definition:-->
Every web service offers a "Service Definition".
It specifies; Request/Response Format (what is the format used for req and res), Request Structure, Response Structure, Endpoints

Service Provider(Server) - is the web service, Is the one that hosts the web service
Service Consumer(Client) - Applications are Service Consumers, since they consumes/uses the web service
Service Definition - Given above

Transport - defines how a service is called. Whther it is exposed over internet or Queue.
Formats are HTTP, MQ:
	HTTP: Basically over web
	MQ: Communication over a queue (both service provider and consumer will listening in queue)
	
// SOAP Web service (Simple Object Access Protocol)		--> It is basically a format of XML
SOAP-Envelope, SOAP-Header (meta info), SOAP-BODY. Service Definition is done by WSDL (Web Service Definition Language)

// REST	--> It is an Architectural Style
Restful Service are basically exploting HTTP methods
HTTP Header, HTTP BODY, HTTP Methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) HTTP Status codes
Resource:-->
It has an URI (Uniform Resource Identifier) --> /user/manoj/list
A Resource can have different representations --> XML, JSON, HTML
Service Definition --> WADL (Web appln Definition Language)or SWAGGER or etc

								REST 			VS 			SOAP
Approach				Architectural Approach			XML
Data Exchange Format XML (SOAP XML)	 				No restrictions
Service Defn		 WSDL			 				No restrictions, not so popularly used WADL
Transport			 WEB or MQ		 				Web (HTTP)
Ease				 complexities	 				Very Easy
