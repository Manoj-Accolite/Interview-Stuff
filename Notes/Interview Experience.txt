// Traverse string from both ends until 'l' and 'r' 
while (l < r) 
{ 
	// Ignore special characters 
	if (!Character.isAlphabetic(str[l])) 
		l++; 
	else if(!Character.isAlphabetic(str[r])) 
		r--; 

	// Both str[l] and str[r] are not spacial 
	else 
	{ 
		char tmp = str[l]; 
		str[l] = str[r]; 
		str[r] = tmp; 
		l++; 
		r--; 
	} 
}
