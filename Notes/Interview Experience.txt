// Interview Experience

1) Which http mthd is used for fetching login fields --> POST mthd (http -> method)

2) In future if we dont want to have any db issues --> hazelcast (Caching shud be used)

3) Diff b/w Web Service and Restful service

4) How an endpoint is authenticated and authorized	--> antMatchers

5) How do we validate when there is an issue in an endpoint

6) Whats Pair Programming??
Pair programming is an agile software development technique in which two programmers work together at one workstation. One, the driver, writes code while the other, the observer or navigator, reviews each line of code as it is typed in. The two programmers switch roles frequently.
Advs :->	Two heads are better than one. If the driver encounters a hitch with the code, there will be two of them who'll solve the problem.
			More efficient. ...
			Fewer coding mistakes. ...
			An effective way to share knowledge. ...
			Develops your staff's interpersonal skills.

7) Prefilter and post filter

8) Sql(Joins) and MongoDB

9) Maps and ConcurrentMap

10) All Http methods will return a response. I mean though GET is used to fetch info, POST, PUT, DELETE will execute some business logic and will return some response

11) Singleton and Doubleton Implementation

12) Producer-Consumer solution using threads in Java

13) What are the best real life example for explaining different OOP concepts in any programming language? (Quora)
	https://www.c-sharpcorner.com/UploadFile/a8024d/real-life-example-of-oops/

14) @EnableAutoConfiguration

15) In abstract, when extending abstract class, to avoid implementing methods we can make subclass as abstract itself

16) Good to learn JDBC and Hibernate

17) How do you break singleton https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/prevent-singleton-pattern-reflection-serialization-cloning/

18) Delete a Node from linked list without head pointer (Fast solution is to copy the data from the next node to the node to be deleted and delete the next node. Something like following)
soln) 
list.deleteNode(head);
	(OR)
// Delete 15 without sending head 
Node* del = head->next; 
deleteNodeWithoutHead(del);

void deleteNode(Node node) { 
	Node temp = node.next; // Save next node
	node.data = temp.data; // Copy next node's value to the current yet to be deleted node
	node.next = temp.next; // direct the next pointer of current node to next node's next pointer
} 
// Note: This solution doesn’t work if the node to be deleted is the last node of the list. To make this solution work we can mark the end node as a dummy node.
// Also try for Doubly linkedlist

19) Consider the following tables:

Student - Stid, Stname, Details
Subject - Subid, Subname
Marks - Stid, Subid, mark 				Write a query to print the list of names of students who have scored the maximum mark in each subject.
	soln)
		You just have to partition the problem into some bite-sized steps and solve each one by one

		// First, get the maximum score in each subject:

		select SubjectID, max(MarkRate)
		from Mark
		group by SubjectID;

		// Then query who are those that has SubjectID with max MarkRate:

		select SubjectID, MarkRate, StudentID
		from Mark
		where (SubjectID,MarkRate)
		in
		  (
		  select SubjectID, max(MarkRate)
		  from Mark
		  group by SubjectID
		  )
		order by SubjectID, StudentID;
		
		// Then obtain the Student's name, instead of displaying just the StudentID:
		
		select SubjectName, MarkRate, StudentName
		from Mark
		join Student using(StudentID)
		join Subject using(SubjectID)
		where (SubjectID,MarkRate)
		in
		  (
		  select SubjectID, max(MarkRate)
		  from Mark
		  group by SubjectID
		  )
		order by SubjectName, StudentName

20) You are given a date range (from, to). Assume you want to fetch records from db between this range, but since we have so many records it might take lot of time to fetch, instead of fetching records within the range, we could divide the range into small parts. Lets say from is 15/08/2000 and to is 24/12/2000
We could divide this date range to multiple queries like, 15/08/2000 to 31/08/2000, 1/09/2000 to 30/09/2000, 1/10/2000 to 31/10/2000, 1/11/2000 to 30/11/2000, 1/12/2000 to 24/12/2000
so from this range we could have multiple queries to retrieve data rather than fetching everything at once
How do we do it??

// Programs
1) reverse a string without reversing special chars

int r = str.length - 1, l = 0; 

// Traverse string from both ends until 'l' and 'r' 
while (l < r) 
{ 
	// Ignore special characters 
	if (!Character.isAlphabetic(str[l])) 
		l++; 
	else if(!Character.isAlphabetic(str[r])) 
		r--; 

	// Both str[l] and str[r] are not spacial 
	else 
	{ 
		char tmp = str[l]; 
		str[l] = str[r]; 
		str[r] = tmp; 
		l++; 
		r--; 
	} 
} 

2) Reverse and Add Function
3) Logic to count nodes in a Circular Linked List
4) Balance Array
5) Smallest subarray with sum greater than x
6) Find Mean and Median of array
7) MinStack

// Doubleton Pattern
public class Doubleton{
    private static Doubleton objDoubleton1;
    private static Doubleton objDoubleton2;
    private Doubleton(){
    }
    
    // Factory Method
    public  static Doubleton getInstance(){
        if(objDoubleton1 == null){
            objDoubleton1 = new Doubleton();
      return objDoubleton1;
        }
        else if(objDoubleton2 == null){
            objDoubleton2 = new Doubleton();
      return objDoubleton2;
        }
        else{
           if(Math.random() < 0.5)
          return objDoubleton1;
           else
          return objDoubleton2;
        }
    }
    // override clone method
    public  Object clone(){
        return this;
    }
}

// OO Design
"OO model for lift system", "OO model for chess"
You should be able to use interfaces, static classes etc. pretty well.
	1) Tic-Tac-Toe game
	2) A seating arrangement was to be designed for airplane management system
	3) To display the day of week after adding/subtracting a number from a day.
		Example : “ Monday +3” should give Thursday. “Monday -3” should give Friday.
		["Monday", "Tues", "Wed", "Thurs", "Fri", "Sat", "Sun"] --> with this we can find index of day and then we can add/subtract based on input number and operand
	4) Make a snake and ladder game.
	5) calculate Taxi fare like Ola/Uber does (different prices for all vehicle like mini, sedan, SUV ), they had given all the formulations according to which we have to develop a code, they give us approx 2 hours
	6) Sales Tax Problem
	7) Mars Rover Problem
	8) IPOD Inventory
